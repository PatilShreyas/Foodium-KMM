## About 

It simply loads posts data from API and displays them on the UI. The network API is a dummy (fixed)
response which is _statically hosted 
[here](https://patilshreyas.github.io/DummyFoodiumApi/api/posts/)_. The concept of this app is 
originally taken from [this project](https://github.com/PatilShreyas/Foodium/).

Currently, it only shows a one Home screen with listing of posts. The following features will be
integrated in the app and _Work is in Progress..._
